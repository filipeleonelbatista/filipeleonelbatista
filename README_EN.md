## ðŸ’¼ Professional Experience

### Recrutei â€“ Frontend React Engineer

*Aug 2024 â€“ Dec 2024*

I participated in the implementation of the Ultra functionality, which incorporated AI-based analyses to increase the
accuracy of the selection process. I was responsible for developing the complete Ultra job creation flow, as well as the
intelligent listing of candidates, displaying match scores based on alignment with the ideal profile. This functionality resulted in an increase of approximately 12% in hiring accuracy, driving the migration of customers to AI-based plans and contributing to a conversion of approximately 18% of new customers.

### Stefanini Group â€“ Frontend Engineer React/React Native

*Sep 2022 â€“ Jul 2024*

In a project for a large global supermarket group, I worked on the creation and development of two projects, a
mobile application for a benefits club and a web application for managing orders in electronics stores. To this end, I
developed interfaces that facilitated the flow of redeeming benefits and checking statements, adjusting the performance to
support input devices and delivering a better experience in React Native. And we created a store experience by integrating
internal SAP and TOTVS systems with robust APIs, React.js with TypeScript and creating reports that helped in decision
making. As a result, we impacted around 4 million users, generating BRL$800 thousand in sales when the benefits club was
launched, and we increased the operational productivity of the stores by 20% with service and reports facilitated for the
management team.

### Moben â€“ Full Stack Engineer

*Jul 2021 â€“ Sep 2022*

I worked at a real estate startup, where a small team of 5 people was responsible for serving around 1,000
customers. I developed and maintained both the user interface and the backend of the application, with a focus on creating
the flow for generating rental contracts. This functionality resulted in over 300 closed contracts, streamlining communication with tenants through automatic messages about payments, and offering more predictability and peace of mind to landlords.

### Salux Technology â€“ Software Developer

*Jul 2021 â€“ Sep 2022*

Worked in a real estate startup where a lean team of 5 people was responsible for serving about 1,000 clients. Developed and maintained both the user interface and backend of the application, with emphasis on creating the rental contract generation flow. This functionality resulted in more than 300 closed contracts, optimizing communication with tenants through automatic payment messages, and offering more predictability and peace of mind for property owners.
